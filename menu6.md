# Citing

To credit the SciML software, please star the repositories that you would
like to support. If you use SciML software as part of your research, teaching, or other activities,
we would be grateful if you could cite our work. Since SciML is a collection of individual
modules, in order to give proper credit please cite **each related component**.

To give proper academic credit, all software should be cited.
[See this link for more information on citing software](https://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/about/#q11).
Listed below are BibTex citations corresponding to portions of the SciML
software tools. For software which do not have publications, recommended
citations are also included. If you have any questions about citations,
please feel free to [ask in the community channels](/community.html).
